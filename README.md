##  Key Steps in the Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
-  Handled missing values using **time-based interpolation**.
-  Removed **negative energy readings** caused by sensor errors.
-  Capped **outliers using the IQR method** to reduce skewness.

### 2. Feature Engineering
-  Created **temperature differential features** (e.g., `zoneX_temp - outdoor_temp`) to better reflect HVAC workload.
-  Computed **rolling statistics** (4-hour mean & standard deviation) to capture short-term trends in energy usage.

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation
-  Evaluated the following **six regression models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
###  Model Performance Comparison

| Model               | RMSE  | MAE   | R¬≤   |
|---------------------|-------|-------|------|
| Gradient Boosting   | 19.48 | 12.30 | 0.77 |
| Linear Regression   | 19.87 | 12.56 | 0.76 |
| Ridge Regression    | 19.87 | 12.56 | 0.76 |
| Lasso Regression    | 19.87 | 12.55 | 0.76 |
| Random Forest       | 20.05 | 12.47 | 0.76 |
| XGBoost             | 21.28 | 12.83 | 0.73 |

## Results & Insights

### üîç Top Findings
-  **Temperature control** has a significant impact on overall energy consumption.
-  **Time-based features**, such as hour of the day and rolling averages, greatly improve model accuracy.
-  **Sensor anomalies** (e.g., negative readings or extreme spikes) are likely indicators of malfunctioning equipment.

## Recommendations
1) Reduce temperature differentials between zones and outdoors.
2) Monitor high-consumption periods (rolling mean helps detect anomalies).
3) Add more sensor data (equipment status, production load).

## Conclusion
The Gradient Boosting model (R¬≤=0.77) provides reliable predictions for energy consumption. Key takeaways:
1) Temperature management is crucial for reducing energy use.
2) Time-based features improve prediction accuracy.
3) Real-time monitoring can help optimize energy efficiency.
